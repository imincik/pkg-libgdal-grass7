libgdal-grass (1.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced a strict build-dep on libgdal1-dev to use the new path
    for plugins and avoid problems in building.
    The same strict dependency should be present in libgdal1-1.7.0,
    but the -1 version never landed in testing so it is pointless.
  * Fixed debian/rules to use the new path for plugins.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Feb 2011 11:55:10 +0100

libgdal-grass (1.6.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Previous change for regenerating from template was not effective.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Mar 2010 22:07:25 +0100

libgdal-grass (1.6.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now forces regenerating from templates at clean time. That
    shall allow binNMUs whenever Grass versions changes.
  * Policy bumped to 3.8.4 without changes.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Mar 2010 09:41:50 +0100

libgdal-grass (1.6.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

libgdal-grass (1.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now strictly depends on the full grass ABI version. This is useful 
    because it can change even in release candidates and minor versions.
    So, better being defensive to avoid unnoticed breakages.
  * Depends on gdal >= 1.6.2 to be nice with backports.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Sep 2009 17:06:53 +0200

libgdal-grass (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now it fails if current gdal-dev is misaligned with source version.
    This at least allows failing with FTBS instead of creating invalid
    packages when a binNMU is issued while GDAL is transitioning to a new
    major version.
    (closes: #544978)
  * Now depends at least on incoming 1.6.2-1 gdal-dev version that provides 
    a suitable support patch for the previous trick. 

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Sep 2009 14:58:47 +0200

    should be generated at run-time.
  * Fixed typo in build-dep.
    (closes: #518767)
